Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer position.  As a highly motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to apply my developing skills and contribute to a dynamic team.

My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in core programming concepts using languages like C, Java, and Python. I am particularly drawn to frontend development and am actively seeking opportunities to expand my practical experience in this area. My understanding of problem-solving and management principles, coupled with my technical abilities, allows me to approach challenges strategically and efficiently.

My project experience, including the development of a Sign Language Detection System using Python and Machine Learning, demonstrates my ability to apply technical skills to real-world problems.  Furthermore, my experience with cloud computing and AWS, gained through my project on Kubernetes and my training at Technical Guftgu, provides me with valuable insights into modern development practices.

My involvement in extracurricular activities, such as coordinating the 2-year induction program for B.Tech (Hons.) students and actively participating in E-CELL, has honed my organizational and teamwork skills. These experiences have also reinforced my passion for technology and innovation.

I am eager to learn from experienced professionals and contribute to a challenging and rewarding work environment. I am confident that my enthusiasm, coupled with my developing technical skills, makes me a suitable candidate for this position. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

Kushagra Singh
