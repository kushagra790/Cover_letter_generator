Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Frontend Developer position.  As a highly motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to apply my developing technical skills and contribute to a dynamic team.  My expected graduation in June 2026 provides me with a solid foundation in key programming concepts and a strong desire to learn and adapt quickly.

While my academic focus has provided me with a broad technical base including C, Java, and Python, I am particularly drawn to the challenges and creativity inherent in frontend development. I am eager to deepen my knowledge in this area and contribute to building engaging and user-friendly interfaces.  My project experience, including the development of a Sign Language Detection System using Python and Machine Learning, demonstrates my ability to apply technical skills to solve real-world problems.  Furthermore, my experience with cloud computing, particularly with AWS through my training with Technical Guftgu, provides me with valuable insights into deploying and managing web applications.

My coursework and extracurricular activities have fostered essential professional skills, including problem-solving, management, and collaboration.  As a coordinator for the 2-year induction program for B.Tech (hons.) students, I honed my organizational and communication skills, while my involvement in E-CELL and participation in Technex (IIT BHU) have further developed my ability to work effectively in team settings.

I am confident that my enthusiasm, combined with my technical aptitude and commitment to continuous learning, makes me a strong candidate for this position. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how I can contribute to your team's success.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Kushagra Singh
