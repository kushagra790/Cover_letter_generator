Dear [Hiring Manager or Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Frontend Developer position at Juspay. As a highly motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to contribute my growing skillset to a dynamic and innovative company like yours.

My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in core programming concepts using languages like C, Java, and Python. I am particularly drawn to frontend development and am eager to further develop my skills in this area.  My project experience, including the development of a Sign Language Detection System using Python and Machine Learning, demonstrates my ability to apply technical knowledge to solve real-world problems.  Furthermore, my exposure to cloud computing concepts, including AWS and Kubernetes, provides me with a valuable understanding of modern development practices.

I am a quick learner and possess strong problem-solving abilities, which I honed through my coursework and projects.  My experience coordinating the 2-year induction program for B.Tech (Hons.) students and my active involvement in E-CELL at my university have further developed my management, communication, and teamwork skills.

I am confident that my dedication, combined with my technical aptitude and eagerness to learn, will make me a valuable asset to your team.  I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to Juspay's success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

KUSHAGRA SINGH
