[Address, if known]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Frontend Developer position at Juspay. As a highly motivated and dedicated Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for developing innovative and user-friendly web experiences to your team.  I anticipate graduating in June 2026.

My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, Java, and Python.  I am particularly drawn to frontend development and am actively expanding my knowledge and skills in relevant technologies. My project on Sign Language Detection, utilizing Python and Machine Learning, demonstrates my ability to apply technical skills to solve real-world problems.  Furthermore, my experience with cloud computing, including AWS and Kubernetes, as part of another project and my Technical Guftgu training, aligns well with the evolving technological landscape of modern web development.

My internship at Technical Guftgu provided valuable hands-on experience with Cloud, Linux, Ubuntu, and AWS, further solidifying my understanding of these crucial technologies.  I am confident in my problem-solving abilities and my proactive approach to learning new technologies, allowing me to adapt quickly and effectively to the demands of a fast-paced development environment.

Beyond my technical skills, I possess strong communication and teamwork skills honed through my involvement in various extracurricular activities. My experience coordinating the 2-year induction program for B.Tech (hons.) students and my active participation in E-CELL have developed my organizational and leadership abilities.

I am confident that my skills, experience, and passion for frontend development make me a strong candidate for this position. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how I can contribute to Juspay's success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Kushagra Singh
