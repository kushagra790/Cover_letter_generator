Dear [Hiring Manager or Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Frontend Developer position at Juspay.  As a highly motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to apply my developing skills and passion for technology to contribute to your team.

My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, Java, and Python. I am particularly drawn to frontend development and am actively expanding my knowledge and skills in relevant technologies.  I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges, which I believe are essential qualities for success in this dynamic field.

My project experience, including the development of a Sign Language Detection System using Python and machine learning, demonstrates my ability to apply technical skills to solve real-world problems.  This project, along with my work on a Kubernetes project involving AWS and cloud computing, has honed my problem-solving abilities and provided valuable experience working with different technologies.  My internship at Technical Guftgu further solidified my understanding of cloud technologies, including AWS, Linux, and Ubuntu.

Beyond my technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving, management, and communication skills.  My involvement in extracurricular activities, including coordinating a two-year induction program and active participation in E-CELL, has further developed my leadership and teamwork abilities.

I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and how my skills and enthusiasm can benefit Juspay. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Kushagra Singh
