Dear [Hiring Manager or Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Frontend Engineer position at Juspay.  As a highly motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, I am eager to contribute my developing skills and passion for technology to your team. I anticipate graduating in June 2026 and am actively seeking opportunities to gain practical experience in frontend development.

While my academic background provides a solid foundation in core computer science concepts, including proficiency in C, Java, and Python, I am particularly drawn to the challenges and creativity inherent in frontend engineering.  My project experience, such as developing a Sign Language Detection System using Python and Machine Learning, has honed my problem-solving abilities and provided valuable experience in working with complex systems.  Furthermore, my coursework in DBMS and SQL has equipped me with an understanding of data management principles, crucial for building robust and efficient web applications.

My internship with Technical Guftgu exposed me to practical applications of Cloud Computing and AWS, giving me valuable insights into the technologies driving modern web development.  I am confident that my combined academic knowledge and practical experiences align well with the requirements of this role.

My involvement in extracurricular activities, including coordinating the 2-year induction program for B.Tech (Hons.) students and actively participating in E-CELL, demonstrates my leadership, teamwork, and organizational skills. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and eager to contribute to a dynamic and innovative environment like Juspay.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Kushagra Singh
