Amazon Hiring Team
[Amazon Address (if known), or leave blank]

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Development Engineer (SDE) position at Amazon.  As a highly motivated and results-oriented Computer Science Honours student at GLA University, graduating in June 2026, I am confident that my skills and experiences align well with the requirements of this role.

My passion for software development is evident in my diverse project portfolio. The "Sign Language Detection System" project, utilizing Python and machine learning, demonstrates my ability to develop predictive models and provide data-driven insights.  My experience with cloud computing, particularly with AWS and Kubernetes, as showcased in my "Kubernetes" project, highlights my understanding of managing and orchestrating complex systems. Furthermore, developing the "WellTrack - Health Management Platform" allowed me to leverage generative AI, build digital health cards, and implement personalized recommendations using machine learning, showcasing my ability to work on full-stack projects with a focus on user experience.

My internship at Technical Guftgu further solidified my understanding of cloud technologies, including AWS, Linux, and Ubuntu.  My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in C, Java, and Python, as well as database management systems and SQL.  I am also a proactive learner, demonstrated by my completion of Coursera courses on Innovation Through Design and SQL, as well as AWS training through Technical Guftgu.

Beyond technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving, management, and promotional skills.  My involvement in extracurricular activities, including coordinating the 2-year induction program and active participation in E-CELL, demonstrates my leadership and organizational abilities.  My participation in Technex (IIT-BHU) and Cognizance (IIT Roorkee) further underscores my commitment to staying abreast of the latest technological advancements.

I am eager to contribute to Amazon's innovative environment and collaborate with talented engineers.  I am confident that my passion for technology, combined with my skills and experience, makes me a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

Kushagra Singh
